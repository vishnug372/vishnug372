<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Apps:</h2>

- <b> DiaBuddy </b>
  - [Swift Code](https://github.com/DiabuddyCSW-Cab/Diabuddy4)
  - DiaBuddy is an app designed to support people in efficiently identifying risk of diabetes and managing diabetes
  - The app was made in XCode using Swift
<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Machine Learning Projects:</h2>

- <b> Diabetes Risk Classifier </b>
  - [Model code](https://github.com/vishnug372/DiabetesModel/tree/main)
  - Used in DiaBuddy, a Support vector classification model that predicts risk of contracting diabetes at 80 percent accuracy during testing
  - Risk factor analysis to identify which factors were most important in predicting
  - Model takes in inputs: Pregnancies, Glucose Levels, Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Diabetes Pedigree function, Insulin
  - Made in Google Colab using Python -- libraries used: Sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- <b> Facial Emotion Detection</b>
  - [Model Code](https://github.com/vishnug372/FacialEmotionDetection/tree/main)
  - Used various models (neural networks, knn) to classify a specific emotion given an image of a face
  - Used euclidian distance to analyze points across the face
- <b> Predicting Student Loan Default Rates  </b>
  - [Model Code](https://github.com/vishnug372/PredictingStudentLoanDefaultRates/tree/main)
  - Made in participation of the Data Science challenge by Skew The Script
  - Using a database of colleges, created a model to best predict student loan default rates
  - Used R programming language
